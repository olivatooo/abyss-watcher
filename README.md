# Abyss Watcher

## Get reports for EVERY CLICK IN AWS! 

Watch your AWS infrastructure live through cloudtrail logs and export it to discord, slack, telegram,  whatever you want! Honestly I don't know if other projects like this exist. But I don't care, it's faster to make my own anyway.


## How it works

Cloudtrail -> Event Bridge -> Lambda -> Abyss Watcher ---> [Slack, Discord, Telegram, Your Mom]
